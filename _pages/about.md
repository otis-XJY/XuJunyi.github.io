Welcome to my academic homepage! I am a PhD candidate at the [Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://www.ia.ac.cn/), specializing in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning and Drone Swarm Control.

About Me
======
I received my Bachelor's degree from [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/) and am currently pursuing my PhD under the supervision of [Advisor's Name] at the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences. My research focuses on:

- Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning algorithms
- Distributed control of drone swarms 
- Low-altitude autonomous systems
- Cooperative decision-making in complex environments

Research Approach
======
My work combines theoretical development with practical applications, aiming to bridge the gap between AI algorithms and real-world robotic systems. I employ a variety of techniques including:

- Deep reinforcement learning
- Distributed optimization
- Swarm intelligence
- Game theory
